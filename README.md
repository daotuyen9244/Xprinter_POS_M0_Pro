# USBPrinter driver for USB Host Library for SAMD

This driver is designed to work for small USB thermal printers. Do not expect
this to work for laser or inkjet printers because they require complex software
support.

This has been tested with the USB Host Library for SAMD and the ESC POS Printer
library on an Arduino Zero.
